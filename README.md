## Background Info
Dice (singular die or dice) are small, throwable objects with marked sides that can rest in multiple positions. They are used for generating random numbers, commonly as part of tabletop games, including dice games, board games, role-playing games, and games of chance.
In this opportunity we'll simulate rolls and keep track of how many times each side lands, to keep track of both Snake-eyes (1, 1), Doubles and so on.
