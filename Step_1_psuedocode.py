# PHASE ONE: First Step is pseudocode! Try to learn this process. It
# will help with the planning phase. All I do is write out the logic
# steps to perform a task:


# Step 1: Import random module


# Step 2: Create two (2) die objects 


# Step 3: Create a Data Structure to store dice-roll results


# Step 4: Ask user how many roll simulation that want to run:


# Step 5: Create a loop for desired iteration


# Step 6: Store the sum of dice1 and dice2 in a data structure 


# Step 7: Print Results
